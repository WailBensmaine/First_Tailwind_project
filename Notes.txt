** Commands needed : 
    1/ npm tailwind init
    2/ npm init -y
    3/ npm i -D prettier-plugin-tailwindcss

** The 'scripts' object in the 'package.json' file is usefull when it comes to alias the long commands, it will replace any value in the object with 'npm run' followed by its key; Exapmle (  npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./build/css/style.css --watch ==> npm run tailwind  )

** In css, the psudeo classes"before" and "after" start from the middle of their element in term of width and from the start of their element in term of height

** Always check if the 'content' array in the tailwind configuration file contains all the files you need to use tailwind classes into, you may need to update it after creating another files with different extentions

** Before every push, make sure to format the code using prettier format by running the command ',pm run prettier' so all the collaborators can use the same order of inserting tailwind classes
